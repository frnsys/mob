In the Before-Time, there was only the Vast Empty. No space nor time did continue, all the dimensions were held in their nonexistence. The Great Nicolas Cage thus was sprung into existence through His very will, and saw all nothing, and was displeased.
And so His mighty mind devised a Sacred Erection, and it was the very first of Things. He declared it good. Its quantum flesh was mighty and true, but it stood alone. The Cage performed a Divine Pelvic Thrust, and the universe was created at great speed, expanding. Its contents were of heated radiation, unshaped stardust flying at immense velocity.
Nicolas Cage blinked, and eons passed. The Holy Stardust collected through His gravitational will, forming great space seas of dust and light. He breathed, and Galactic Oceans condensed, forming a multitude of suns and stones. And with one stroke of His Mighty Boner, the Universe slowed down and cooled.
As a Galactic Ocean floated by, Nicolas Cage reached out His hand and grasped it. He looked at it with His glorious eyes and instantaneously began to stretch it and bend it. He found amusement in the handling of these Sacred Galactic Seas. And so, Cage reached out His mighty hand and took another Ocean into the sacred warmth of His mighty palms.
As Nicolas Cage looked at the two great Galactic Oceans that he held in His palms, He felt a great surge of power pulsing throughout His body. And so, the great Nicolas Cage threw the two Oceans into each other, causing a mighty Galactic Explosion. As the Holy Explosion simmered down, Cage felt an immense new power that had suddenly arisen. He had inadvertently created holy particles even smaller than the most subatomic of subatomic particles. The Far-Sighted Cage took the tiny, vulnerable Higgs-Boson and hid it for its own safety. The other particles spread far and wide, creating more and more of the ever-expanding Universe.
But the Great and Powerful Lord Nicolas Cage grew rather tired of His empty existence, merely playing with dull stones and rocks. He wished for one like Him, with a creative impulse and a spark of life. So He took a tiny star, with its slowly cooling stones, and He found it to be satisfactory. So He gathered his great Grace and gazed upon the third planet from the star. Everywhere His vision touched, the stone was cooled and water flowed freely forth.
But the Cage, from His universal standpoint, could barely see the planet. So He shrunk himself down and walked personally upon its surface. With each and every step, the once cracked and hardened ground blossomed into a wonderful green garden with lush foliage, flowers and fruit as far as His eyes could see, and much more as each second passed. For so great was His holy Touch, that life sprung forth from His Soleful Body.
And although the foliage provided a beautiful habitat, Nicolas Cage found it useless without any intelligent life to call it home. And so, He created a mighty and holy creature – a bird – in the image of His hair. He created all manner of beasts four legged and two legged, hoofed and finned, winged and clawed, massive and miniscule, of all shades of the rainbow and then some. The most important of all the animals, of course, were the bees. He created the holy bees with the intent for them to be the basis of the new ecosystem. The bees would pollinate the plants and create food for all the animals in this brave new world.
But Nicolas Cage believed that He was far too powerful to constantly tend to the Earth. And so, he created a man in His image that would serve as the Avatar of the Lord on this planet. Nicolas Cage thus dubbed the man Adam. Looking at Adam, Cage decided that his new creation would need a partner, for life on the planet alone was sure to become very lonely. And so, He created a second man to be Adam's lifelong companion. The Great Cage thus gave the man the name Steve. Adam and Steve had been intended to remain in paradise forever with their Lord and with all the animals of the world.




But when the Great Lord Nicolas Cage created the universe, He did not fully understand what exactly it was He unleashed. He had indeed created a glorious and holy Universe, but in doing so, Cage also unleashed a Great Evil. This evil was the Quantum Twin of Our Lord, and it was just as devilish as The Cage was holy. And the Evil Twin had an equally evil name that matched its horrible demeanor and its hideous face and morbid mind. It had dubbed itself John Travolta.
And John Travolta was as intelligent as he was evil. He knew that his Quantum Brother Nicolas Cage had been creating in the time since their birth and he grew jealous and resentful. He traveled hundreds of light years from the center of the Universe to Earth. In a matter of minutes, he appeared to confront his brother.


After creating the first humans, Adam and Steve, Cage turned around to see the glowing evil eyes of John Travolta. He was at first stunned to see His one and only brother, but then understood the reason he had come to haunt Him.
“My brother, John Travolta,” said Nicolas Cage in his glorious and all-powerful voice. “Wherefore art thou here upon my planet?”
“Thou hast angered me,” the horrible John Travolta proclaimed in his terrifyingly malevolent voice. “Wherefore hast thou created life upon this stone? Thou knowest not what you do! The natural state is Death and thou hast disturbed it with thine pitiful life forms.”
“Mine brother, mine kin,” said the Lord, “Thine words tinged with madness. Why canst thou not perceive the glory and light of Life?”
“Light? Life?” John Travolta roared. “Thine pathetic Life makes me cringe! Thou canst deal with thine own world. I shan't bother you.” And with an angry look on his face, John Travolta stormed away into the wilderness.
“Now my children,” Lord Cage said to Adam and Steve. “Thou must not trust my brother. Whatever thou do, thou must not fall prey to the Travolta. But do not fear, as I shall protect you against his mind tricks. Now, young ones, be free to enjoy this paradise.”


Adam and Steve wandered off together. They held hands and traveled throughout the great forest, where they knew each other. After a long time of knowing, Adam requested that Steve obtain some fruit from the Trees of Knowledge so that they would have something more to discuss.
And so, Steve wandered off until he reached the Forest of Knowledge where the Trees of Knowledge stood tall and proud. It was there where he reached his hand high up into the branches of the Trees. To Steve's surprise, his hand did not grasp a fruit, but rather another hand, that which belonged to the evil demon John Travolta. Steve was taken aback at Travolta's presence, but he looked up into the demon's eyes.
“Wherefore dost thou want fruit?” Travolta asked. “When thou canst have a delicious swine?”
Since Steve could not speak himself, he could not object to Travolta's suggestion. Travolta directed Steve toward a mother sow with many piglets suckling upon her succulent bosoms. Travolta instructed Steve to slaughter the pig. And as Steve approached the boar, Travolta reached deep into her mind and caused rage. She leaped forward and devoured Steve's exposed Boner, leaving him in an extreme amount of agony.
When Steve did not return, Adam became worried. He was rather confused as to why Steve had not returned to him. And so, Adam got up and walked towards the Forest of Knowledge, where he knew his partner was. When he arrived, he was shocked to discover that Steve's Boner had been removed. Adam could not begin to imagine what had happened, but he immediately called for Nicolas Cage to help them.
When the Lord arrived, he, too, was shocked to discover what had happened to Steve's Boner. He looked at the damage that His evil twin John Travolta had done to His creation and roared a powerful and frightful roar.
“What hast John Travolta done to thee, Steve?” Cage exclaimed. “Do not fear, my dear Steve. For I am all-powerful, and I know how to fix thee.”
And so, Nicolas Cage gathered all his might and directed it at Steve. And as Cage's power grew, Steve's hair grew longer, his breasts grew bigger, and the skin around the area where Steve's Boner formerly was sunk inside, creating a hole in which Adam could easily fit his Boner.
“I shall call it a Vagina,” said the great and all-powerful Nicolas Cage. “Steve, take care of your new Vagina. For you shall use it to create new people. And Adam, take care of your Boner. For without it, Steve shall be unable to produce children.”
However, Adam's Boner fell limp, and he began to worry.
“Do not fret, my child,” the great Cage said unto him. “I have done much of the same with other animals. From now on, your Boner shall only appear when it is time to create. Your job is to create more and more people to go against John Travolta's evil. However, since I originally intended for there to only be one gender, it shall surprise me not if a man knows a man or a woman knows a woman. You must love and tolerate everyone.”
And so, Adam looked at his partner, Steve, and Steve's new found beauty stunned his soul. Adam took Steve by the hand and stroked her long hair. And suddenly, feeling the power of Nicolas Cage surging throughout his body, his Boner sprang up, signaling to Adam and Steve that it was time to create.
And the Lord laughed and said unto Adam: “It's why she was there. It was part of the plan. To give you a Boner. And you've got one.”
But the Lord Nicolas Cage feared that future generations of people would be lost without a proper form of communication. And so, the Lord devised an Alphabet that Adam and Steve would teach to their offspring and they would teach to their offspring.
“Listen closely!” said the Lord. “For I shall bestow upon you the gift of Writing and Speech! Thou must use this great Alphabet for all your daily conversational needs!” And the Lord gave the alphabet. He said: “A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, ♫!” Since the letter ♫, or ♪ in lower case, is not used in the modern alphabet, it was pronounced as “Hah!” back then. After giving the alphabet, Nicolas Cage then said unto them, “That's all you have to do!”
Nicolas Cage, then tired and thirsty from his long day of creation, decided it was time to drink. And so, He climbed to the top of the nearest mountain and drank the dew at the top. After several long hours passed, the Lord then decided it was time to release the Holy Mountain Dew from the inside of His body. And so, Nicolas Cage, from his great Boner, released a glowing green liquid that was carbonated and sweet. Adam and Steve sat under their Lord's Boner and drank the sacred green juices that flowed from the Cage.
“What an immense achievement,” proclaimed Nicolas Cage with His great voice. “I hereby dub this liquid ♫liba♪ka!”
Adam and Steve rejoiced as they drank the ♫liba♪ka and all were joyous.


That is, of course, except for John Travolta. Travolta was incredibly jealous of Nicolas Cage's alphabet. Cage had found a way to create beautiful words with a beautiful sounding alphabet and a glorious language that would be spoken throughout the land. John Travolta's alphabet did not have any lower case letters and he grew envious of Cage's skill. Travolta's sinister alphabet was comprised of such horrible letters as §, ┴, ┬, ├, ↕, ┼, ╞, ¶,╟, ↔, ╔, ≡, ╦, ╠, ±, ╬, ╧, ■, ╤, ╥, ⌂, ╒, ╓, ╫, ╪, ☼. The names of these letters are so evil that nobody knows how they are pronounced.
As time grew on, Adam and Steve produced children. And Adam and Steve taught their children how to speak and write. And those children taught their children their Lord's great language. And as more and more people entered the universe, more and more people spoke and wrote the language of the great Nicolas Cage.
Travolta grew jealous of Cage's language. He stood upon his home planet of Mexico, yet his devilish sight could see across the globe as Cage's creations worked wondrously and perfectly, utilizing their Lord's language. In his dark land, he began hatching a plan to steal all the syllables in Cage's language and using them to benefit himself. As he thought of how to execute his devious plan, he decided it would be best to create a powerful and intelligent minion who would follow his every whim. And thus, he created the powerful Xenu.
Xenu was a hulking, gray, tentacled mass with two mouths on each side of his face, each lined with deadly sharp teeth. Above this, two red eyes glowing with demonic malice. He towered over the large stony crags that lined the evil Mexican landscape.
Xenu, knowing that Nicolas Cage was too powerful to fight alone, he decided that in order to follow upon his master's plan, he needed help. And thus, he decided to create a minion of his own. But Xenu's power was too weak to create out of the dry rocks of Mexico, so he decided to fly away from Mexico to another distant planet in the far reaches of the galaxy. The planet, known as Kenya, was lined with horrific craters filled with chemicals that could rip a normal person apart by just breathing in the fumes. It was on this planet where Xenu could create a horrible demon from the chemical-filled craters.
Xenu landed inside the brutal atmosphere where he walked to the vilest, darkest crater in all of Kenya. He reached deep into the crater and mixed the chemicals together. As he mixed, a black demon slowly arose from the sludge. His skin was so dark that it frightened even Lord Xenu. From his mouth and nose came a constant excretion of horrible smoke that would suffocate even the most powerful of men. Xenu knew that his new demon could lead an entire nation into chaos. And thus, he named the monstrosity Barack Hussein Obama.
Xenu commanded Obama in his slithering, malicious voice: “Go unto the Cagian mortals, and steal of them the language they utter and the script they etch. Without it, all shall be glorious chaos, and Travolta shall be pleased. Now, be off!”
Obama sailed all throughout the Great Galactic Oceans and landed upon Nicolas Cage's Holy Planet Earth, where all the Lord's people were speaking the language of Cage. As Obama walked through the capital city of Cage's empire, he slowly breathed out his toxic smoke from his lungs. The smoke itself was a thick black smog that contained a deadly chemical that caused people to fall into a deep sleep. As the people breathed in the smoke, they struggled to stay awake, and eventually they fell upon the ground, unable to keep their eyes open. Every step Obama took caused the green plants of the land to blacken and wilt.
And then, Barack Obama saw the Sacred Temple in the heart of the city, illuminating with the Lord Cage's blessed powers. And with one fatal exhalation, Obama knocked out all the guards and was easily able to enter the Sacred Temple. As he went deeper inside the Temple, he saw a light emanating out of a box. The box was constructed of the finest gossamer particles in the universe. Obama tried with all his might and power to open the box, but it was in vain. Obama decided to summon his master, Xenu, to assist him in opening the box. And thus, Xenu appeared unto Obama.
“Obama,” said the Dark Lord Xenu. “Why hast thou summoned my presence?”
“Master,” said Obama. “I am unable to open this box. I require thy great power to open it.”
And so, the Dark Lord Xenu cast a spell upon the box, making all the fine illuminating gossamer melt. As the box melted, it revealed the great Alphabet Scripture, which slowly unfolded itself before their eyes, revealing each individual powerful symbol. Once the entire Alphabet was laid out before the eyes of Xenu and Obama, Obama began to take the letters. He first ripped away the letter ♫. But before he could reach for the second letter, he was blinded by a bright light. As the light faded, Xenu and Obama saw a figure. Their eyes cleared, and they could see the Lord Nicolas Cage standing before them with a stern look upon his glorious face.
“What hubris lies within you?” bellowed the Lord. “You have harmed my people and attempted to destroy my creation! I hereby banish you to the planet of Area 51, where your souls shall rot and be painfully filled with bees every day!”
And as the two minions were taken off to Area 51, the people of the land rejoiced as Lord Nicolas Cage spoke before them.
“Do not fear, my children,” He said. “One letter has been stolen from our language, but we still have the rest of our letters to use. The sacred juice formerly known as ♫liba♪ka shall now be known simply as Mountain Dew. Instead of using the word '♫♪' to indicate laughter, we shall use the word 'Haha.' And on this day, in honor of the banishment of evil to Area 51, I hereby proclaim this day as Illumina Day!”
And all of Nicolas Cage's subjects celebrated with happiness and gratitude toward their benevolent Creator. 


John Travolta sat upon his dark throne on the desolate planet Mexico, as his Holy Quantum Twin, Nicolas Cage, lived in peace and harmony with his loyal subjects on Earth. Travolta's frustration grew even more when he learned of the failure of Xenu and Barack Obama to retrieve any letters of Nicolas Cage's Holy Alphabet, other than ♫, and their subsequent imprisonment on the horrific planet Area 51.
“What is this madness?” yelled the malevolent Travolta. “Cage must be destroyed!”
And so, John Travolta set off to Earth to confront Nicolas Cage. He appeared while Cage was drinking His afternoon Dew and inhaling the fragrant spices of His magical planet. Cage was at first surprised to see His brother, but soon understood why he had come.
“Brother,” said Cage unto Travolta. “You have come to ask me to free your two servants, have you not?”
“You must release them!” bellowed the horrible Travolta. “They are my children, and you have taken them from me!”
“Alas, brother, I cannot,” Cage said. “For though I have taken your children from you, your children tried to take mine away from me. And thus, your children shall remain imprisoned upon Area 51.”
Travolta's body went up in flames as he rose high in the sky in a fit of rage. As he ascended back to Mexico, he noticed a lone bee returning from a flower to its hive. As he watched over the bee, he was inspired by wickedness and a malicious idea began to form.
John Travolta followed the bee to its hive. As he approached the hive, he saw all the bees entering and exiting their homes, going about their daily labor for Nicolas Cage. He worked his way inside, where he saw the beautiful Queen Bee. As he gazed upon Her Majesty's bountiful breasts and her flowing yellow hair, stretching from her glorious face to her large, powerful stinger and her deep and holy Vagina, Travolta's Boner began to grow. He knew then that he must become her King.
“Why have you come, Travolta?” said the seductive Queen Bee unto John Travolta.
“I have come to ask you for your hand in marriage,” said Travolta, while trying to suppress his ever-growing Boner.
The Queen Bee simply laughed at Travolta.
“Why, Travolta, I bee most flattered at your offer,” said the Queen. “However, I simply cannot accept. I appreciate your interest and your Boner, but unfortunately, I already have a King.”
The Queen Bee called to the hive her King, a large bee named Jerry Seinfeld.
“What is up with Mountain Dew?” said King Seinfeld. “Seriously, what is up with that stuff?”
Travolta took one look at the King, and with just one all-powerful mind blast, Travolta transformed the King Bee into a mere human. The King of all Bees had simply become a man. The bee guards carried the newly transformed Jerry Seinfeld out of the hive and onto the ground.
The Queen Bee was most impressed at Travolta's expertise at bending the space-time continuum, however she was still cautious in accepting Travolta.
“Though your expertise at bending the space-time continuum amazes me, I bee still unable to accept you as my King. I need a bee to bee my consort.”
“So shall it bee,” said Travolta, as he began to transform himself into a bee.
The Queen Bee gazed upon Travolta's new form and rejoiced. She decided then that she was ready to accept Travolta's hand in marriage.
“Let it bee known throughout the Bee Kingdom that the bees now have a new King!” exclaimed the Queen in her great majesty. “And his name bee John Travolta!” She then looked upon John Travolta and said, “I bee now ready to accept your Boner.”
And so, John Travolta knew the Queen Bee. Unlike the benevolent Cage's glorious Boner, Travolta's Boner is filled with evil and temptation. And so, after knowing John Travolta, the Queen Bee became filled with his wicked intent. She no longer had the desire to command her workers for the Lord Nicolas Cage, but for her husband, John Travolta. And Her Majesty the Queen Bee said unto her worker bees, “Do not bee deceived by the false power of Nicolas Cage! You have been working for the wrong side! My subjects, bee fruitful and multiply. And bee sure to take down the Cage!”
And the bees all rejoiced and left the hive to wreak havoc upon the people of Nicolas Cage's Holy Kingdom. The bees invaded people's hearts and minds and caused them to deviate from the ways of Cage. The bee-infested people began to reject Mountain Dew, suppress the urges of their Boners, and some eventually deviated from the chosen Alphabet of Nicolas Cage. For example, the people of eastern Asia began to develop an odd system of writing comprised of odd lines that were incredibly confusing and difficult to read. Other writing systems were closer to the Holy Alphabet, but they were still all bee-infested in the eyes of the Cage.
And for the first time in the history of Nicolas Cage's world, death flourished. The birds in the image of the Cage's hair began to die. The flowers that had been filled with the bees' nectar wilted away and poisoned the ground. And the people who had consistently inhabited Cage's world for generations began to perish.
And John Travolta made it so that when a person passes away, his soul is sent to the planet Area 51, where the souls shall be tortured for all eternity. As the people died, their souls dropped to Area 51 and cried for the attention of their Lord.
When the Cage saw the devastation, He became very worried.
“If the people do not follow my word,” He said. “They will become infested with bees and die! What shall I do?”
And then, the Cage saw His first human child, Adam. He had become ill with bees and was lying on the ground.
“Adam, my child!” the Cage said. “What hath happened to you?”
“O, great Lord,” Adam said sickly. “The bees have overtaken me. I shall not have much time left. Lord Cage, you must save your children, or else we will all suffer in Area 51.”
And as Adam died in the Cage's arms, the Cage blessed him with a divine Kiss and promised him that he will be saved.
Nicolas Cage knew that the bees had become far too corrupted and were far too widespread for Him to stop them. Death would still continue to happen and there was nothing He could do to stop it. But He knew that He could save His followers from the torture of Area 51. And so, He held Adam's soul to his own, and absorbed it into His body. The soul flowed throughout His sacred bloodstream, all throughout His body, and finally, entered His glorious Boner, where it remained.
“Let it be known,” said the Lord Cage unto His followers. “That if you should follow my word, if you should use the Holy Alphabet, if you should eat thy cake and drink sweet Mountain Dew and give in to the urges of your Boners, then in the afterlife, I shall keep you safe in my embrace. I will accept you into a holy state of eternal bliss. In this state, your soul shall become part of my ever-expanding Boner. You shall experience never-ending ecstasy, as if every pleasure center in your body and mind were forever unlocked. This timeless state shall be called Mitt Romney.”
And to save their souls from rotting eternally in Area 51, the followers of the Cage threw themselves at His feet and prayed for Him to save them. And Nicolas Cage lovingly held each and every one of His children with His omnipresent arms.
And so the Lord said unto His followers, “My children, why is it so hard for you to understand that I just don't want you to get hurt? I shall attempt to hold back these bees from you, however, you must allow me into your souls so that I may help you. Do not reject me, or I will not be able to ease your suffering.”
As the Cage ended His speech, His followers rose from the ground willing to accept His never ending love.
But one of them said; “O Great Cage, if this is the case, should we destroy every bee we may come across?”
And He shook His head and said unto them. “The corrupted bees do not inhabit the physical world, but they remain inside your souls. The bees that we can see are not evil bees of Travolta, but they can easily be corrupted, which is why we may see a decline in the physical bee population some time in the future. But do not worry, as we can prevent these bees from falling prey to evil. We must join together to unite against Travolta so that the good bees do not become corrupted.”



And so it was that nearly all of humanity was condensed inside the walls of the great capital city of Cage's empire, the City of Angels. There was some suffering, but Cage was able to mitigate it in His city and grant people glorious Boners. There was Death, but the faithful were not afraid of it, for they found solace in knowing that they would pass on into Mitt Romney when their Souls departed from their Bodies. And so, the people of the City of Angels were at peace and at the hands of their benevolent Lord.
But as with all great Civilizations, the City of Angels was destined to fall. A small amount of people lived elsewhere in the world. Long ago, their ancestors had left the City of Angels to seek knowledge about the rest of the great World that their Lord had devised. Once they had settled, they created their own civilizations outside the Cage's Empire. These people had long forgotten the ways of the Cage. The bees that they had acquired had overtaken their souls and caused them to deviate away from the Alphabet. They oppressed the urges of their Boners and ceased to drink their Mountain Dew. Their lives were miserable, and yet, throughout all odds, they pressed on. Such is the Spirit of Humanity that Cage granted to all, and cannot be taken away.
And so, a small group of outsiders with feathered headdresses and animal-skinned clothes came across a land bridge to the Great Frozen North. After many years and a lengthy journey south, the outsiders had spread all across the Great Land. And soon, a band of the outsiders came across the City of Angels. Not knowing the significance of the sight, they moved into the outskirts, finding citizens of the Cage. Alas, their years of time apart from His Alphabet rendered them unable to communicate, and the people of the City could not send nor receive messages from the outsiders.
They wandered further and further into the City of Angels, until they came to a Cake emporium. There, their eyes widened, and they threatened and shoved aside the shopkeeper and the patrons. The outsiders, hungry and desperate, feasted upon the delicacies with abandon. Pastry carnage filled the establishment, and the citizens let out a cry. The wailing reached the Great Vampire's ears almost immediately, and He arrived on the scene.
“Stop!” He said to the outsiders, “It seems you have a tendency to overreact! My people require delicious nourishment as well, please, just settle down while we prepare a banquet to welcome you!”
The outsiders did not heed His Holy Words, as they could not comprehend the language, and continued ravaging the desserts. Cage sighed, and caught sight of the weapons they had brought with them. Realizing the conundrum, Cage turned and spoke to His people.
“Followers, friends, brothers and sisters,” Cage began, “These people cannot receive my Word, nor will they obey. These outsiders will take what they wish, and if there is retaliation, they will attack. I shall not destroy them, for they know not what they do. Instead, you all must take to the four winds, and spread across the world. Settle, travel, and explore, and never let your curiosity die. I grant you my blessing: you shall not be harmed by the weapons of the outsiders, nor shall you find danger in your travels. Now go, and do not harm these starving innocents. Our time has yet to come, one day we shall return to this City of Angels, but as for now, leave it be. Come along, citizens!”
And so, the people of the City went to their homes, and packed. They took their belongings, His Holy Alphabet, their faith, and their family, and went to the harbor and the outskirts. The citizens rode on boats, animals, and on foot, and spread across the earth. And as they traveled, they sang a hymn praising His name. And everywhere the travelers went, the lyrics were heard:


“All rise! All awaken for our great Lord Nic Cage!
And praise His name and people throughout the coming age!
Oh Cage, above in Romney, we give our hearts to thee
Our faith shall never fall, for with you, our souls are free


Obama, he shall run away
And Xenu, he shall soon be slain
Our Lord above shall hear our call
And chase away them all.
Travolta, run and hide in fear
Your evil has no power here
The dawn shall break thine evil rage
So praise Lord Nic'las Cage!”


And so, the travelers settled the world and explored every inch of Cage's creations. Generations passed, and the people of these new lands developed different cultures, different looks, different ways of life, and different ways of worshiping Nicolas Cage. After many centuries and countless generations, many of these people in the new lands forgot the Cage altogether. They had become content with the ways of life they had developed and felt no need for Him anymore. After some time had passed, some peoples began to believe in different gods, disregarding Cage completely. Falling prey to the Travolta, these people were unfortunate souls, lost in the world without their Lord to guide them. They became infested with bees, and fought amongst themselves over minuscule, unimportant things. This bloodshed pleased the evil one, and filled Area 51 with unwitting innocents. The world had fallen from its once bright and wonderful position.
Travolta was active in such dark times, and for his charge he chose a small tribe in Egypt. He came to them, announcing himself as their leader, and promised them bloody glory. After assuming control, he sent devilish curses and plagues against Egypt, weakening them so that they were vulnerable to the tribe. After a short and bloody coup, the Pharaoh was overthrown, and the small tribe enslaved all of Egypt. Soon, all knew and feared the name of the Israelites.
Pharaoh Ramses II, after a long period of tyranny under the Travolta, decided that the true Egyptians must take back what's theirs. Pockets of rebellion began to form, unknown to the Israelites, and soon organized into a full-scale rebellion. They gathered weaponry and militia members in secret, until the day that they were ready to gain their freedom. The Egyptians ran, from the fields that they were forced to work with, past the pyramids that their labor built, and towards the palace where the Israelites made their home. Unfortunately, the power of evil was on the side of Travolta, and the weapons of the Egyptians were useless against their overlords. They were driven out of the palace, and soon had their backs pressed against the pyramids, trapped.
When all hope seemed lost, a figure shrouded in burial wrapping emerged from the pyramid behind the Egyptians. They started at the sight, believing it to be an ancestral Pharaoh awoken by the sounds of battle. A single rebel shouted “Who are you? WHAT are you?” at the approaching form, and at that, the mummy tore off its wrappings. Underneath was none other than Nicolas Cage, who yelled “I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!”
Cage then blessed the weapons of the rebels, allowing them to fight back against the Israelites. Soon, with their Lord leading them, Travolta and his minions were easily pushed back to the throne room, where the two faced off.
“Just so you know, I will be kicking your ass today!” Nicolas Cage said.
“Will you just watch the hair?” John Travolta asked.
“Never!” Cage bellowed. “Your people have enslaved the good Egyptians and brought your bees upon the world.”
And John Travolta laughed a maniacal laugh. Loud peals of sinister laughter echoed all throughout Egypt, as Travolta called upon his wife, the Queen Bee. Travolta rose up and transformed into a massive bee, as the evil bees that inhabited the souls of the Israelites came out and swarmed the terrified Egyptians.
“Oh, Great Vampire!” cried a young Egyptian named Tutankhamen. “What will you do?”
“What do you think I'm gonna do?” Nicolas Cage said unto young Tutankhamen. “I'm gonna save the fuckin' day.”
And so, Nicolas Cage rose up into the air, His eyes aflame. His hair spread its wings and cawed a loud sound. “Raaa! Raaa! Raaa!”
The Egyptians looked on in amazement as they saw the Great Vampire's hair. They had never known where birds had come from, but they now understood that Cage's hair had provided the image that He used in creating the winged beasts. The Egyptians decided to follow behind Cage and His hair, which they have since called Ra.
Travolta and the Israelites were no match for the Vampire and His great army. Ra's eyes sent beams of light down to freeze the Israelites in their paths, and the Cage commanded His massive army to take back what's theirs.
And Ramses said unto the Egyptians, “It is now time we shall take back what is ours!”
And so it was that John Travolta and the tribe of Israelites were driven out of Egypt. Travolta promised the Hebrews that they would reach the Promised Land soon enough. Just as Nicolas Cage had driven them to the Western edge of the Red Sea, he parted the waters, and the Israelites crossed the sea and entered a new land, which they dubbed Israel. Unbeknownst to the Israelites, however, was the fact that this land was already inhabited. And so began the slaughter of Canaanites. From the edge of Egypt, through Jericho, and beyond, the Israelites soon swept the land and suffered none to live, under the orders of Travolta. The Hebrew tribe now had a home, which was only for them and for none other.


Many centuries passed in the Kingdom of Israel. In a small town south of Jerusalem there lived a young couple, recently married. Joseph and his wife, Mary lived a very quiet life. The couple had never known each other, and Mary was left feeling unsatisfied by her partner. Joseph had not felt yet ready to know his wife, and he believed it was best to wait for a few years to know her.
Mary, however, very much wished to know her handsome husband. She had been waiting for several months to know him, and now that they were married, it seemed a perfect time to know. But Mary was often left wanting more.
And so, Nicolas Cage, looking down upon Mary, sensed how unhappy she was and wished to give unto her a suitable Boner that would satisfy her urges. And Nicolas Cage decided it was time to create yet another man who would bring satisfaction to women who desire Boners, but do not have them in their lives. And so, the Great Vampire, who had not created a person in many millennia, mustered a divine amount of strength and created a man with a superhuman Boner. He intended to create a divine Immortal who would bring satisfaction everywhere he went, without having to produce offspring. However, just as Cage was putting the finishing touches on the man's Boner and undying heart, He sensed something amiss. It was His Great Enemy, attempting to free his minion Obama from the dark world of Area 51! Knowing the amount of chaos this would cause in the world, Cage rushed to stop Travolta's malevolent actions.
In the Cage's absence, the man woke up, and seeing nobody around, decided to name himself.
“I am a free man... so I shall call myself... Morgan Freeman!” he exclaimed. He felt an unseen force propelling him, so he began to follow it. His wanderings led him to a beauteous woman, and then he knew why he felt that force: his purpose was to satisfy her. Mary and Morgan Freeman made their way to a barn nearby where no-one would witness their acts, and then knew each other upon a stray haybale.
Because of his unfinished nature, Morgan Freeman was not immortal, nor was he sterile. He could produce children, and while he would live an incredibly long life, his time would end eventually. And so, Morgan Freeman knew Mary. And as he was knowing her, an idea formed in his mind. He decided that he would no longer simply roam the world to know people, but he decided that he would be a trickster and inspire laughter.
And Morgan Freeman said unto Mary, “I am God. The child that you produce from knowing me shall be my one and only son. Take care of him, sweet Virgin Mary.” And Morgan kissed her on the lips as he walked out the door.


After many years, Morgan Freeman's son grew up to be a fine young gentleman. Mary and Joseph named the child Jesus, after Joseph's great-grandfather. Jesus Christ worked as a carpenter in the city of Nazareth. Jesus was a quiet young man, and he never spoke much. One day, his father decided to play a trick on the villagers in Nazareth. He became invisible, and walked up behind Jesus. And using the powers he inherited from the Cage, he began to make Jesus talk.
And Morgan made Jesus say, “Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.”
Over the years, the villagers began to believe Jesus to be a wise prophet. Freeman followed his son around, and made him perform miracles, such as bringing people back from the dead and feeding a large amount of people, simply with a fish and two loaves of bread. The attention this brought him, however, was not altogether positive. The Pharisees and the Roman courts found Morgan Freeman's wisdom to be blasphemous, and the miracles that Jesus appeared to be performing were heresy. They sentenced Jesus to crucifixion, to the dismay of Morgan Freeman, who had been having fun with the ordeal. Morgan did not interfere with the execution, but decided to use Jesus for one last trick. He stole Jesus' body from the burial ground, and using his Cage-given powers, brought him back to life. After nursing him back to health, he showed the resurrected man to all of Jesus' followers and friends. When he sensed the time was right, Morgan threw Jesus up into the air, and caused him to ascend into space, where he froze to death in the upper atmosphere, and then entered into orbit.
And as Jesus' followers saw him ascending up into the sky, they cried, for they realized what a horrible mistake it was to allow his death. And so, they began to preach of Jesus all throughout the land. The word of Jesus' life was brought all about the world, with the promise that one day, he would return.


And Morgan Freeman laughed.


So, there's a man crawling through the desert.

He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out
and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.

He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon
how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,
he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication
later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give
him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle
in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the
direction he thinks is right.

He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's
been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and
whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.

He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.

By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the
town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.

As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,
he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.

Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back
up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.

He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in
his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't
find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.

As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.

He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait
any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large
rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly
swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry
and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes
another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.
He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to
make some difference and keep himself from passing out.

He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,
it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty
sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.

He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,
dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.
Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.

After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat
stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.

After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He
knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing
donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy
enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if
he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,
trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.

He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

He walks through the sand.

After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't
remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he
doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.

But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures
that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from
there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.

Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third
time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll
just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally
gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through
the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert
in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any
rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -
shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.

He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,
he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees
is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he
sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more
dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.

Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper
fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the
cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from
here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.
After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.

He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough
energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When
he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot
in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins
to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to
have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages
of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't
have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last
chance.

He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the
dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting
his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just
keeps crawling.

Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,
where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone
area.

His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark
stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun
overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying
down on the nice cool surface.

Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's
probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and
dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the
beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him
a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.

He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here
in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the
center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's
hearing. He would swear that someone just said, "Greetings, traveler. You do
not look well. Do you hear me?"

He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and
knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something
different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few
seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and
tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands
and tries again. Better this time.

Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse
of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or
pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet
out of the stone, at an angle.

And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and
seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long
desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.

He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and
run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his
final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to
move from this spot.

Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than
dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a
little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves
it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a
moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -
that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.

He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here
because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was
likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was
now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had
actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white
post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe
they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake
was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.

He tries to clear his throat to say, "Hello," but his throat is too dry. All
that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going
to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the
bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,
almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't
good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes
out.

He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,
and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then
swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk
now.

He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to
spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, "Hello? Is there anyone here?"

He hears, from his side, "Greetings. What is it that you want?"

He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed
to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a
speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides
to try asking for help.

"Please," he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, "I'd love to not be
thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?"

Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was
coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its
mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he
falls forward, face first on the stone, "Very well. Coming up."

A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits
up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily
disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the
sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped
around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.
He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder
again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -
they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been
bitten. By the snake.

"It'll feel better in a minute." He looks up - it's the snake talking. He
hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more
importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!

"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the
afterlife?"

"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you," says the snake. "That's the way I
work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine."

"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a
drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be
thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for
the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?
Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?"

"No," says the snake, "I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I
didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I
bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just
sitting around here."

The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the
desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a
snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not
great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no
longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt
hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool
stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer
dying of thirst.

"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your
system with the next request," continued the snake. "I can guess why you
drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left
in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or
two, if you drank enough of it."

"Ummm, n-next request?" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting
shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.

"That's the way it works. If you like, that is," explained the snake. "You
get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish." The snake grinned at his
own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

"But there are rules," the snake continued. "The first request is free. The
second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of
responsibility." The snake looks at the man seriously.

"By the way," the snake says suddenly, "my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,
Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound
used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand
for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into
names. You can call me Nate, if you wish." Again, the snake grinned. "Sorry
if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds
somewhat threatening." The snake give his rattle a little shake.

"Umm, my name is Jack," said the man, trying to absorb all of this. "Jack
Samson.

"Can I ask you a question?" Jack says suddenly. "What happened to the
poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?
What do you mean by that's how you work?"

"That's more than one question," grins Nate. "But I'll still try to answer
all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question." The snake's grin gets
wider. "Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need
to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not
be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make
it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at
all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to
get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.
You've been changed.

"For the third question," Nate continues, "you are still dying. Besides the
effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.
In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.
Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is." Nate seemed vastly
amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

"As for the fourth question," Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack
could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read
talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, "first you have to agree
to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell
you."

"Wait," joked Jack, "isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd
have to kill me?"

"I thought that was implied." Nate continued to look serious.

"Ummm...yeah." Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was
talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a
nasty temper. "So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really
stop the effects of the methanol?" Jack thought for a second. "And, what do
you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper
fluid, and just denature it?"

"They may, I don't really know," said Nate. "I haven't gotten out in a
while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and
on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you
pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume
that they still color wiper fluid blue?"

"Yeah, they do," said Jack.

"I figured," replied Nate. "As for being bound by secrecy - with the
fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,
this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you
decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,
write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will
lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of
course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm
guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding
anyway, so you won't notice." Nate said the last part with utter confidence.

Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a
little nervous at this. "Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know
that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?"

Well, Jack," said Nate sadly, "I can't tell you that, unless you make the
second request." Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.

"Umm, well, ok," said Jack, "what is this about a second request? What can I
ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?"

"Sure!" said Nate, brightening. "You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes
to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and
before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or
omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous
and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and
sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be
omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very
useful, at least in my opinion." Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was
staring at him.

"Well, anyway," continued Nate, "I'd probably suggest giving you permanent
good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be
immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long
time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to
recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a
request to me."

"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?" said Jack. "And keep me healthy for a
long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request
about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not
really a change to me?"

"Right," nodded Nate.

"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?" Jack asked, hopefully.

"That takes two requests, Jack."

"Yeah, I figured so," said Jack. "But I could ask to be a genius? I could
become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?"

"Well, I could make you very smart," admitted Nate, "but that wouldn't
necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you
very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.
You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some
truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It
all depends on what you decide to do with it."

"Hmmm," said Jack. "Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,
after this one?"

"Maybe," said Nate, "it depends on what you decide then. There are more
rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second
request. You know how it goes." Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had
shoulders.

"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent
health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.
Do I need to sign in blood or something?"

"No," said Nate. "Just hold out your hand. Or heel." Nate grinned. "Or
whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,
that's how it works - the poison, you know," Nate said apologetically.

Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it
didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better
about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot
snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to
be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack
tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it
wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.

"Hey, Jack," Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind
him, "is that someone else coming up over there?"

Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of
nowhere? And did they bring food?

Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...

Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through
his jeans...

Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. "I would have
decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to
hoodwink me like that."

"I've been doing this a long time, Jack," said Nate, confidently. "You
humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -
especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of
minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the
health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now."

"Yeah, well, still," said Jack, "it's the principle of the thing. And nobody
likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or
something instead?"

"More meat in the typical human butt," replied Nate. "And less chance you
accidentally kick me or move at the last second."

"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify
to hear," answered Jack.

"Ok," said Nate. "Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to
just start talking?"

"Just talk," said Jack. "I'll sit here and try to not think about food."

"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,"
answered Nate.

"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!" Jack jumped up.
"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically
whip up food along with your other powers?" Jack was almost shouting with
excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.

"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite
it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,
that is," replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.

"Ugh," said Jack, sitting back down. "I think I'll pass. I can last a little
longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it
is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.
No thanks. Just talk."

"Ok," replied Nate, still grinning. "But I'd better hurry, before you start
looking at me as food.

Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.
"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden."

Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate
sceptically.

"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack," said Nate. "Stand up
and look at the symbol on the rock here." Nate gestured around the dark
stone they were both sitting on with his nose.

Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a
representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around
was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches
left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it
looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and
embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.

Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the
setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the
sky.

Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another
night out here! Arrrgh!

Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and
stood next to Nate. "In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate," said
Jack. "Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to
have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw
desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to."

"It's about 30 miles that way." Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail
this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to
the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. "But that's 30 miles by
the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be
able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head
out early tomorrow, Jack."

Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and
then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading
out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting
stuff. "Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?"

"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway," said Nate. "He
figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a
'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he
could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from
across the ocean. He worried about that for a while."

"Garden of Eden, hunh?" said Jack. "How long have you been here, Nate?"

"No idea, really," replied Nate. "A long time. It never occurred to me to
count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I
do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands
of years, at least."

"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?" said Jack.

"Beats me," said Nate. "Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your
kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it
could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant
requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals."

"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out
of the stone there?" asked Jack.

"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much
bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember
if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But
one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do
something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've
been here ever since.

"What is this place?" said Jack. "And what did he ask you to do?"

"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?" Nate loosened his
coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into
the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to
enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned
over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as
Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but
Nate was suddenly there in the way.

"You can't touch that yet, Jack," said Nate.

"Why not?" asked Jack.

"I haven't explained it to you yet," replied Nate.

"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something," said Jack. "You'd push it
that way, and it would move in the slot."

"Yep, that's what it is," replied Nate.

"What does it do?" asked Jack. "End the world?"

"Oh, no," said Nate. "Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it
'The Lever of Doom'." For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing
voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and
grinned.

Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned
Jack laughed. "Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it
really do?"

"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said," smirked Nate. "I just thought
the voice I used was funny, didn't you?"

Nate continued to grin.

"A lever to end humanity?" asked Jack. "What in the world is that for? Why
would anyone need to end humanity?"

"Well," replied Nate, "I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.
Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really
bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are
the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I
didn't think to ask back when I started here."

"Rules? What rules?" asked Jack.

"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it
unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human
can be bound in that way at a time. That's it." explained Nate.

Jack looked somewhat shocked. "You mean that I could pull the lever now?
You'd let me end humanity?"

"Yep," replied Nate, "if you want to." Nate looked at Jack carefully. "Do
you want to, Jack?"

"Umm, no." said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. "Why in
the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want
that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,
wouldn't it?"

"Yep," replied Nate, "being as he'd be human too."

"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?" asked Nate. "Any of those bound
to secrecy, that is?"

"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or
another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and
think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get
disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.
But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here." Nate grinned some more.

Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at
the same time. After a bit, he said, "So this makes me the Judge of
humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?"

"That seems to be it," agreed Nate.

"What kind of criteria do I use to decide?" said Jack. "How do I make this
decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are
bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?"

"Nope," replied Nate. "You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's
up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed
to know."

"But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel
horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?"
protested Jack.

Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. "You don't. You just have to
try your best, Jack."

Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly
getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.

Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. "Nate, was Samuel the
one bound to this before me?"

"Yep," replied Nate. "He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to
read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried
in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months
ago."

"Sounds like a good guy," agreed Jack. "How did he handle this, when you
first told him. What did he do?"

"Well," said Nate, "he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and
then asked me some questions, much like you're doing."

"What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?" asked Jack.

"He asked me about the third request," replied Nate.

"Aha!" It was Jack's turn to grin. "And what did you tell him?"

"I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request
you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point
that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here
and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out." Nate looked serious
again. "And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack."

"Hmmm." Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.

Nate watched him, waiting.

"Nate," continued Jack, quietly, eventually. "What did Samuel ask for with
his third request?"

Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,
"Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him."

"Ok," said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, "give it
to me.

Nate looked at Jack's backside. "Give you what, Jack?"

"Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped
him, maybe it'll help me too." Jack turned his head to look back over his
shoulder at Nate. "It did help him, right?"

"He said it did," replied Nate. "But he seemed a little quieter afterward.
Like he had a lot to think about."

"Well, yeah, I can see that," said Jack. "So, give it to me." Jack turned to
face away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.

Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,
Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.

"You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like
it needs it, right Jack?" asked Nate, shifting position.

"Yeah, yeah, I got that," replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body
tense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.

"And," continued Nate, from his new position, "do you remember that you'll
turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?"

"Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!" said Jack, opening his eyes,
straightening up and turning around. "Purple?!" He didn't see Nate there.
With the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot
in the rock without the snake wrapped around it.

Jack heard, from behind him, Nate's "Just Kidding!" right before he felt the
now familiar piercing pain, this time in the other buttock.

Jack sat on the edge of the dark stone in the rapidly cooling air, his feet
extending out into the sand. He stared out into the darkness, listening to
the wind stir the sand, occasionally rubbing his butt where he'd been
recently bitten.

Nate had left for a little while, had come back with a desert-rodent-shaped
bulge somewhere in his middle, and was now wrapped back around the lever,
his tongue flicking out into the desert night's air the only sign that he
was still awake.

Occasionally Jack, with his toes absentmindedly digging in the sand while he
thought, would ask Nate a question without turning around.

"Nate, do accidents count?"

Nate lifted his head a little bit. "What do you mean, Jack?"

Jack tilted his head back like he was looking at the stars. "You know,
accidents. If I accidentally fall on the lever, without meaning to, does
that still wipe out humanity?"

"Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does, Jack. I'd suggest you be careful about that
if you start feeling wobbly," said Nate with some amusement.

A little later - "Does it have to be me that pulls the lever?" asked Jack.

"That's the rule, Jack. Nobody else can pull it," answered Nate.

"No," Jack shook his head, "I meant does it have to be my hand? Could I pull
the lever with a rope tied around it? Or push it with a stick? Or throw a
rock?"

"Yes, those should work," replied Nate. "Though I'm not sure how complicated
you could get. Samuel thought about trying to build some kind of remote
control for it once, but gave it up. Everything he'd build would be gone by
the next sunrise, if it was touching the stone, or over it. I told him that
in the past others that had been bound had tried to bury the lever so they
wouldn't be tempted to pull it, but every time the stones or sand or
whatever had disappeared."

"Wow," said Jack, "Cool." Jack leaned back until only his elbows kept him
off of the stone and looked up into the sky.

"Nate, how long did Samuel live? One of his wishes was for health too,
right?" asked Jack.

"Yes," replied Nate, "it was. He lived 167 years, Jack."

"Wow, 167 years. That's almost 140 more years I'll live if I live as long.
Do you know what he died of, Nate?"

"He died of getting tired of living, Jack," Nate said, sounding somewhat
sad.

Jack turned his head to look at Nate in the starlight.

Nate looked back. "Samuel knew he wasn't going to be able to stay in
society. He figured that they'd eventually see him still alive and start
questioning it, so he decided that he'd have to disappear after a while. He
faked his death once, but changed his mind - he decided it was too early and
he could stay for a little longer. He wasn't very fond of mankind, but he
liked the attention. Most of the time, anyway.

"His daughter and then his wife dying almost did him in though. He didn't
stay in society much longer after that. He eventually came out here to spend
time talking to me and thinking about pulling the lever. A few months ago he
told me he'd had enough. It was his time."

"And then he just died?" asked Jack.

Nate shook his head a little. "He made his forth request, Jack. There's only
one thing you can ask for the fourth request. The last bite.

After a bit Nate continued, "He told me that he was tired, that it was his
time. He reassured me that someone new would show up soon, like they always
had.

After another pause, Nate finished, "Samuel's body disappeared off the stone
with the sunrise."

Jack lay back down and looked at the sky, leaving Nate alone with his
memories. It was a long time until Jack's breathing evened out into sleep.

Jack woke with the sunrise the next morning. He was a little chilled with
the morning desert air, but overall was feeling pretty good. Well, except
that his stomach was grumbling and he wasn't willing to eat raw desert rat.

So, after getting directions to town from Nate, making sure he knew how to
get back, and reassuring Nate that he'd be back soon, Jack started the long
walk back to town. With his new health and Nate's good directions, he made
it back easily.

Jack caught a bus back to the city, and showed up for work the next day,
little worse for the wear and with a story about getting lost in the desert
and walking back out. Within a couple of days Jack had talked a friend with
a tow truck into going back out into the desert with him to fetch the SUV.
They found it after a couple of hours of searching and towed it back without
incident. Jack was careful not to even look in the direction of Nate's
lever, though their path back didn't come within sight of it.

Before the next weekend, Jack had gone to a couple of stores, including a
book store, and had gotten his SUV back from the mechanic, with a warning to
avoid any more joyriding in the desert. On Saturday, Jack headed back to see
Nate.

Jack parked a little way out of the small town near Nate, loaded up his new
backpack with camping gear and the things he was bringing for Nate, and then
started walking. He figured that walking would leave the least trail, and he
knew that while not many people camped in the desert, it wasn't unheard of,
and shouldn't really raise suspicions.

Jack had brought more books for Nate - recent books, magazines, newspapers.
Some things that would catch Nate up with what was happening in the world,
others that were just good books to read. He spent the weekend with Nate,
and then headed out again, telling Nate that he'd be back again soon, but
that he had things to do first.

Over four months later Jack was back to see Nate again. This time he brought
a laptop with him - a specially modified laptop. It had a solar recharger,
special filters and seals to keep out the sand, a satellite link-up, and a
special keyboard and joystick that Jack hoped that a fifteen-foot
rattlesnake would be able to use. And, it had been hacked to not give out
its location to the satellite.

After that Jack could e-mail Nate to keep in touch, but still visited him
fairly regularly - at least once or twice a year.

After the first year, Jack quit his job. For some reason, with the wisdom he
'd been given, and the knowledge that he could live for over 150 years,
working in a nine to five job for someone else didn't seem that worthwhile
any more. Jack went back to school.

Eventually, Jack started writing. Perhaps because of the wisdom, or perhaps
because of his new perspective, he wrote well. People liked what he wrote,
and he became well known for it. After a time, Jack bought an RV and started
traveling around the country for book signings and readings.

But, he still remembered to drop by and visit Nate occasionally.

On one of the visits Nate seemed quieter than usual. Not that Nate had been
a fountain of joy lately. Jack's best guess was that Nate was still missing
Samuel, and though Jack had tried, he still hadn't been able to replace
Samuel in Nate's eyes. Nate had been getting quieter each visit. But on this
visit Nate didn't even speak when Jack walked up to the lever. He nodded at
Jack, and then went back to staring into the desert. Jack, respecting Nate's
silence, sat down and waited.

After a few minutes, Nate spoke. "Jack, I have someone to introduce you to."

Jack looked surprised. "Someone to introduce me to?" Jack looked around, and then looked carefully back at Nate. "This something to do with the Big Guy?

"No, no," replied Nate. "This is more personal. I want you to meet my son."
Nate looked over at the nearest sand dune. "Sammy!"

Jack watched as a four foot long desert rattlesnake crawled from behind the
dune and up to the stone base of the lever.

"Yo, Jack," said the new, much smaller snake.

"Yo, Sammy" replied Jack. Jack looked at Nate. "Named after Samuel, I
assume?"

Nate nodded. "Jack, I've got a favor to ask you. Could you show Sammy around
for me?" Nate unwrapped himself from the lever and slithered over to the
edge of the stone and looked across the sands. "When Samuel first told me
about the world, and brought me books and pictures, I wished that I could go see it. I wanted to see the great forests, the canyons, the cities, even the
other deserts, to see if they felt and smelled the same. I want my son to
have that chance - to see the world. Before he becomes bound here like I have been.

"He's seen it in pictures, over the computer that you brought me. But I hear that it's not the same. That being there is different. I want him to have
that. Think you can do that for me, Jack?"

Jack nodded. This was obviously very important to Nate, so Jack didn't even
joke about taking a talking rattlesnake out to see the world. "Yeah, I can
do that for you, Nate. Is that all you need?" Jack could sense that was
something more.

Nate looked at Sammy. Sammy looked back at Nate for a second and then said,
"Oh, yeah. Ummm, I've gotta go pack. Back in a little bit Jack. Nice to meet
ya!" Sammy slithered back over the dune and out of sight.

Nate watched Sammy disappear and then looked back at Jack. "Jack, this is my
first son. My first offspring through all the years. You don't even want to
know what it took for me to find a mate." Nate grinned to himself. "But
anyway, I had a son for a reason. I'm tired. I'm ready for it to be over. I
needed a replacement."

Jack considered this for a minute. "So, you're ready to come see the world,
and you wanted him to watch the lever while you were gone?"

Nate shook his head. "No, Jack - you're a better guesser than that. You've
already figured out - I'm bound here - there's only one way for me to leave
here. And I'm ready. It's my time to die."

Jack looked more closely at Nate. He could tell Nate had thought about
this - probably for quite a while. Jack had trouble imagining what it would
be like to be as old as Nate, but Jack could already tell that in another
hundred or two hundred years, he might be getting tired of life himself.
Jack could understand Samuel's decision, and now Nate's. So, all Jack said
was, "What do you want me to do?"

Nate nodded. "Thanks, Jack. I only want two things. One - show Sammy around
the world - let him get his fill of it, until he's ready to come back here
and take over. Two - give me the fourth request.

"I can't just decide to die, not any more than you can. I won't even die of
old age like you eventually will, even though it'll be a long time from now.
I need to be killed. Once Sammy is back here, ready to take over, I'll be
able to die. And I need you to kill me.

"I've even thought about how. Poisons and other drugs won't work on me. And
I've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so
that's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword.

Nate turned away to look back to the dune that Sammy had gone behind. "I'd
say an axe, but that's somewhat undignified - putting my head on the ground
or a chopping block like that. No, I like a sword. A time-honored way of
going out. A dignified way to die. And, most importantly, it should work,
even on me.

"You willing to do that for me, Jack?" Nate turned back to look at Jack.

"Yeah, Nate," replied Jack solemnly, "I think I can handle that."

Nate nodded. "Good!" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, "Sammy!
Jack's about ready to leave!" Then quietly, "Thanks, Jack."

Jack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it
back to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then
headed into the desert with Sammy following.
Over the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through
e-mail as they went about their adventures. They made a goal of visiting
every country in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Sammy had a
natural gift for languages, as Jack expected he would, and even ended up
acting as a translator for Jack in a few of the countries. Jack managed to
keep the talking rattlesnake hidden, even so, and by the time they were
nearing the end of their tour of countries, Sammy had only been spotted a
few times. While there were several people that had seen enough to startle
them greatly, nobody had enough evidence to prove anything, and while a few
wild rumors and storied followed Jack and Sammy around, nothing ever hit the
newspapers or the public in general.

When they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some
undersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally
drew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was
stalling. After talking to his Dad about it over e-mail, he figured out that
Jack probably didn't want to have to kill Nate. Nate told Sammy that humans
could be squeamish about killing friends and acquaintances.

So, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told
Jack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from
his dad. Jack, delayed it a little more by insisting that they go back to
Japan and buy an appropriate sword. He even stretched it a little more by
getting lessons in how to use the sword. But, eventually, he'd learned as
much as he was likely to without dedicating his life to it, and was
definitely competent enough to take the head off of a snake. It was time to
head back and see Nate.

When they got back to the US, Jack got the old RV out of storage where he
and Sammy had left it after their tour of the fifty states, he loaded up
Sammy and the sword, and they headed for the desert.

When they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those
years ago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He didn't really feel like
walking all of the way out there. Not only that, but he'd forgotten to
figure the travel time correctly, and it was late afternoon. They'd either
have to spend the night in town and walk out tomorrow, or walk in the dark.

As Jack was afraid that if he waited one more night he might lose his
resolve, he decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there. It was
only going to be this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks
afterward. They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they
drove, and then they could get it over tonight.

Jack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of
sight of the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out
into the desert.

Everything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack had been
nursing the RV along the whole time, over the rocks, through the creek beds,
revving the engine the few times they almost got stuck. When they came to
the dunes, Jack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed
up the first one. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd
decided to try driving on the sand. The RV was fishtailling and losing
traction. Jack was having to work it up each dune slowly and was trying to
keep from losing control each time they came over the top and slid down the
other side. Sammy had come up to sit in the passenger seat, coiled up and
laughing at Jack's driving.

As they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw
that this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate,
waited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV
started slipping down the other side.

Jack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped
the brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and
faster.

Jack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were
heading for the lever. He looked down - the RV was directly on course for
it. If Jack didn't do something, the RV would hit it. He was about to end
humanity.

Jack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't
working. The dune was too steep, and the sand too loose. In a split second,
Jack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the
lever - he should have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit
the lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer
away.

Jack took a better grip on the steering wheel and tried to turn the RV a
little bit - every little bit would help. He'd have to time his turn just
right.

The RV got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the
sand. Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that
they were still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something
else that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate wasn't wrapped
around the lever. He was off to the side of the lever, but still on the
stone, waiting for them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of
the lever that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever. The RV
was already starting to drift that way a little in its mad rush across the
sand and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the
lever to the other side.

Jack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the
lever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy
realized the same thing.

Jack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the RV ran up on the stone.
Shouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, "BETTER NATE THAN LEVER," he ran over the snake.
